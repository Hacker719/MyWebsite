                <p>While I was looking for sponsorship emails, I decided to give up and look for a email scraper. As I went looking around, I realized literally all of them costed an amount of money! This is why I ended up creating ScrapeMail! ScrapeMail is an npm global module that can scrape email's from a website and scrapes one page deep! You can <a href="https://npmjs.org/~hacker719/scrapemail">find it on npm!</a></p>
